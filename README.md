Medical Image POC — Beginner Documentation
Overview
This is a simple proof-of-concept (POC) project built using Python. The project allows us to process medical images and apply deep learning/AI techniques. It was created step by step by importing code, running models, and integrating them into a working app.
Features
- Upload medical images (like X-rays).
- Apply AI model for detection/classification.
- Get predictions/results in a simple format.
- Beginner-friendly setup (run locally).
Getting Started
1) Install Dependencies
First, install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Common dependencies used in this project are:
- flask
- ultralytics (YOLOv8)
- opencv-python
- numpy
- pillow
- torch
- torchvision
2) Run the Project
Start the app with:

python app.py

Then open your browser at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

You can now upload an image for analysis.

How It Works (Beginner Explanation)
1. You upload a medical image (X-ray).
2. The Flask app receives it.
3. The AI model (YOLOv8) processes the image and makes predictions.
4. The app shows results with:
   - Bounding boxes on the image
   - Confidence scores
   - A summary of findings
Usage
- Open the app in your browser.
- Upload an image file (.jpg, .png, .jpeg).
- Wait for processing.
- View:
  - Image with bounding boxes
  - Summary of detection results
  - Confidence scores
Notes
- If some libraries don’t install, install them one by one using pip install library-name.
- The .pt file is your trained model. Keep it in the project folder.
- Works on CPU by default. If you have a GPU, it will run faster.
     
The project interface it attractive and look like this -

if we put an image as a input in the above program -
<img width="1967" height="1236" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-24 222324" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b18bfea-93f5-4603-970a-aea242095e84" />


Then the output from the project is just like -
